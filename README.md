**Huh? Who am I?**
I am app containing simple games developed originally using *jQuery*, but later on switching to *MEAN*(mongo/express/angular/node) with websocket support.


----------


**How will I become alive?**
If not yet installed (or at first run), install *npm-check-updates*: `npm i -g npm-check-updates`
Afterwards, just:
```
npm-check-updates -u
npm install
node server.js
```
